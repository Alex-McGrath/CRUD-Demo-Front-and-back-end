Assignmnent4\application is a pure nodeJS backend program that runs via a terminal. It demonstrates full CRUD features

Assignment4\HTDOCS - This is the folder from the XAMPP Directory containing my HTML, CSS, JS, and Two PHP files. All frontend.
One for each of the CRUD features we had to implement. In the folder there is also gifs on how each one works.

There are premade files in there from xampp but my files are:

add_user.php
search_user.php
assignment4.js
assignment4.html
assignment4.css
users.sql (the data dump)


Ive also included my data dump in the form of a .sql file and included it into both folders.
